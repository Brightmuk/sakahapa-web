        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared
            when you visit or make a sale/purchase from SakaHapa (the “App”).
        </p>
            <br>
        <h3>Personal information we collect</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When you visit the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
            including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the
            cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the App, we collect
            information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or
            search terms referred you to the App, and information about how you interact with the App.
            We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”. 
            We collect Device Information using the following technologies: 
            - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an
            anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable
            cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. 
            - “Log files” track actions occurring on the App, and collect data including your IP address,
            browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. 
            - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about
            how you browse the Site. 
            Additionally, when you make a sale/purchase through the App, we collect certain
            information from you, including your name, phone number, delivery address and email
            address. We refer to this information as “Order Information”. 
            When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about
            Device Information and Order Information.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>How do we use your personal information?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through
            the App. Additionally, we use this Order Information to: 
            - Communicate with you; 
            - Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and 
            - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or
            advertising relating to our products or services. 
            We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud
            (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our App (for
            example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the
            App, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Sharing your personal Information</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal
            Information, as described above. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us
            understand how our customers use the App -- you can read more about how Google uses
            your Personal Information here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can
            also opt-out of Google Analytics here:<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a> . 
            Also, we may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and
            regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for
            information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Behavioral advertising</h3>
        <br>

            As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted

            Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at
