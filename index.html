    <h4>Step 1: Download the App and Sign In</h4> 
    <br>
<p>Download the App for Free on Playstore or the App store
    and Sign In as a seller.</p>
</div>
<div class="step">
    <h4>Step 2: Respond to Buyer Requests</h4>
    <br>
<p>Sellers are able to view all buyer requests on their
    landing page. If they are able to meet a particular
    buyer's specifications, they can respond to their post
    by clicking on the 'Respond' button inside the specific
    post.
</p>
</div>
<div class="step">
    <h4>Step 3: Receive Response feedback</h4>
    <br>
   <p> Once a buyer receives a seller response, they are at
    liberty to accept or reject the product. The seller will
    then receive feedback of the buyer's response as
    either 'Accepted' for a welcomed response, 'Rejected'
    for a declined response or 'Pending' for a response
    that has not received any feedback.
    
    Once a buyer accepts a product, they will contact the
    seller and arrange how they will get their item.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

    <h4>Tips for Success while Using the App:</h4>
    <br>
    <ol>
       <li>1.  Avoid using photoshopped images. Make sure
        you upload high quality photos of the actual
        product.</li>

<li>2.  Ensure you give a competitive price for your
    product/Response.</li>
<li>3.  Make deliveries within 2 hours to get a favorable
    rating. If this is not possible, communicate to the
    buyer in advance.</li>

<li>4. Always state your delivery terms upfront, whether
    it is Free or subject to additional charges.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Note:</b> The catalogue page allows a seller to advertise
    any unique product they have in stock. The number of
    products a particular seller can upload depends on
    the package they subscribe to. These products can be
    viewed by buyers within a 40km geographical radius
    from the seller.</p>
