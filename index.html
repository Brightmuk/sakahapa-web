            <p><b>SakaHapa </b >s a sourcing App where a buyer can specify the kind of product, he/she is looking
                to purchase and any seller within a 40km radius that has the same item or something similar
                to it can respond with a picture and price. 
                We only point buyers in the direction of the most affordable seller for the item they desire.
                This saves them time they would have otherwise spent physically sourcing for the specific
                product they want. 
                Currently we have incorporated the following categories into the App: Fashion, Electronics,
                Home, furniture &amp; appliances, Mobile phone &amp; tablet, Vehicle &amp; vehicle parts, Health &amp; beaty
                and Property.

                    We provide the buyer with a specialized search feature accessed by clicking on
                    the '+' button at the bottom of their Home page. Here, they can post a sample
                    image of their product if they have one, describe the item in terms of color,
                    material, size, et cetera and choose the correct category in order to post their

                    merchant since sellers have no access to buyers contact information. The buyer
                    can decide to visit the vendor's premises (If they love to inspect items before
                    purchasing), plan a meet-up at a convenient pick-up location or arrange for
                    delivery at an extra cost to be facilitated by the buyer.
