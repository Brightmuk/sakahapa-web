                    fashion products &amp; accessories within a 40km geographical radius. Through our
                    platform a buyer can specify what he/she is looking to purchase and any seller that
                    has the same item or something similar to it can respond with a picture and price of
                    their product.

                    Once the customer identifies what they are interested in they can decide to visit the
                    merchant’s premises and purchase directly from the seller or contact them and
                    arrange for delivery at an extra cost. Payment is done once the shopper receives and
                    inspects the quality of their merchandise. If a client is not able to find what they are
                    looking for from our list of available products, they can use our specialized search
                    feature on the buyer's "MY ORDERS" page where they can post a request with the description of what they want and
                    any seller that has the same item or something similar to it will respond with their
                    offer.

                    Upon registration, the seller will be given 30 free days to test the app. After expiry of the free
                    trial, they will be required to make a monthly subscription of Ksh.300 per month to continue
                    using the app. Once they are enrolled on the app, they will be allocated 10 slots to advertise their
                    products for 30 days. This means that they can only post 10 products at a time on the buyer explore page and after 30 days
                    those products will expire and will no longer be available.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    However, this does not mean that until the 30 days elapse the seller cannot upload a new product.
                    They can choose to delete an item and replace it with another as long as their profile does not
                    exceed 10 products at any given time. Another additional feature for the seller is the ability to get
                    statistics on the 10 products they have uploaded. From their dashboard, they are able to see how
                    many buyers have viewed a certain product and how many have added it to their collection to
                    purchase in the future. For example: Seller XYZ has uploaded a pair of high heels that go for
                    Ksh.4000. On their end, the seller will be able to see on that specific product how many people
                    viewed it and how many proceeded to add to collection. These statistics help the seller to make
                    informed choices such as when to delete a product that does not have favorable statistics or re-
                    upload the same product if it is doing well.

                    On the other hand, buyers are not required to make any form of subscription. They browse
                    through the uploaded products and if they see a product they are interested in they can contact
                    the seller and arrange to purchase it. They also have access to a filter function where they can
                    select products based on price and distance. Another special feature for the buyers is the ability
                    to make a special request if whatever they are looking for has not been uploaded by any of the
                    sellers. For example, buyer ABC can post a request that they are looking for a slim fit, blue,
                    faded jeans, waist 28 and also upload a sample image to make their request more specific. For
                    this specialized service the buyer will be charged only Ksh.20 per request and all sellers within
                    their vicinity (40km radius) will be able to view what they intend to purchase. Any seller that has
                    something close to the requested item will respond with a photo of their product &amp; price. For this
                    personalized advertising to a willing buyer the seller will be charged Ksh.5 to respond to a
                    buyer’s post.

                    The buyer will then review and accept or reject the offers via the app while the sellers will
                    receive notification on the status of their products (whether it was accepted or rejected).
